# Working Notes — RSD (Ready! Set! Dedicate!)

A bidirectional scratchpad shared between Josh, Claude Cowork (Claude desktop chat, used for thinking through ideas), and Claude Code (CLI, used for implementation).

> Both Claude Cowork and Claude Code should read this file when starting a session in this repo.
>
> **Append-only conventions:**
> - "Recently shipped" — newest at top. One bullet per commit, with hash + date + one-line summary. Claude Code updates this after each push.
> - "Ideas / drafts" — drop polished prompts here for the next Claude Code session, or rough ideas you want Claude Cowork to help you refine. No deletion needed; once a draft ships, move it (verbatim) into "Recently shipped" so the history stays intact.

## ⬇ Recently shipped (Claude Code → Claude Cowork)

> What's been built recently, so Claude Cowork has the running context without re-reading the entire git log.

- **`0287706` · 2026-05-08** — Feedback collection on the public demo. New `public.feedback` table (admin-only RLS) + `submit-feedback` edge function (anon, validates roster + category + message). Persistent **Give feedback** button in `DemoPageLayout` auto-fills "Where you are" from the route. Admin review at `/admin/feedback` (filter by status/category, expand row to triage status `new → acknowledged → addressed | declined` and edit `admin_notes` inline). New Feedback nav item in AdminLayout (admin-only). INFRASTRUCTURE.md change-log updated.

## ⬆ Ideas / drafts for the next Claude Code session (Claude Cowork → Claude Code)

> Drop polished prompts here for the next Claude Code session to pick up. When Josh starts a new session with Claude Code, he'll say "read WORKING_NOTES.md, the latest draft is at the bottom" and Claude Code will work from there. Drafts can also be rough — Claude Cowork can help refine them in place before handing off.

<!-- Add new drafts BELOW this line, newest at the bottom so Claude Code works through them in submission order. -->

_(none yet — Claude Cowork, drop drafts here)_
